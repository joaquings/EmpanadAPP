EmpanadAPP is an in-progress application designed to streamline the empanada ordering process. Its primary aim is to offer a user-friendly management dashboard for ordering empanadas with ease.

**Key Features:**

- **Profile Creation:** Create multiple profiles, each with its own customized list of empanadas.
  
- **Ordering Simplified:** When you're ready to place an order, simply select the desired profiles, and the app will automatically generate a consolidated list of empanadas to order. You'll also receive a price estimate for your order.

Please note that this app is currently under development, and we are continuously working to enhance its functionality and user experience. Stay tuned for updates and new features as we make your empanada ordering experience even better!
