EmpanadAPP is an in-progress application designed to streamline the empanada ordering process. Its primary aim is to offer a user-friendly management dashboard for ordering empanadas with ease.

**Key Features:**

- **Profile Creation:** Create multiple profiles, each with its own customized list of empanadas.

- **Ordering Simplified:** When you're ready to place an order, simply select the desired profiles, and the app will automatically generate a consolidated list of empanadas to order. You'll also receive a price estimate for your order.

Please note that this app is currently under development, and we are continuously working to enhance its functionality and user experience. Stay tuned for updates and new features as we make your empanada ordering experience even better!

## What problem does it solve?
I aimed to steer clear of the conventional approach of creating a solution and then identifying a problem, which many often adhere to. Instead, I focused on addressing a weekly challenge my family and I faced during dinner—how to efficiently organize the list of empanadas we intended to order.

With each family member ordering anywhere from 3 to 5 empanadas from a given list, the task was to combine our individual choices to form a coherent order. Without proper organization, the ordering process could easily become confusing. While it might seem like a niche problem, I believe others may also find it relatable.

So, why not maintain a single record? The reason is, my brothers' participation varies—sometimes they join, sometimes they don't. Their preferences also fluctuate, with occasional cravings for an extra empanada due to increased hunger or a reduction in the count for personal reasons.

To address these constant changes and alleviate my weekend concerns, I created an app that simplifies the entire process.
